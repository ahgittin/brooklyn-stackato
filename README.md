# Brooklyn Entities for Deploying and Managing Stackato Instances

This project contains entities for building stackato clusters
with custom roles in multiple clouds.


### Global Hybrid Cloud and Portable Application Examples

This project includes examples for deploying a web application globally, 
moving between stackatos without downtime,
and spanning across them with a GeoDNS provider.

You will need to follow some of the setup for the brooklyn 
"portable cloud foundry" and "global web fabric" examples.
You may also need to perform some stackato user setup (in the web console)
and DNS setup (with your preferred provider) manually.
(These aren't hard to add, so if someone wants to lend a hand
and a pull request, please reach out to brooklyn-dev@googlegroups.com !)
